    <h3 id="headline">"Fran" Allen, a Tech Heroine </h3>
    <p> Frances Elizabeth "Fran" Allen (born August 4, 1932) is an American computer scientist and pioneer in the field of optimizing compilers. Allen was the first woman to win the A.M. Turing award in computing. </p>
    <h3>The A.M. Turing Award</h3>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award">ACM A.M. Turing Award</a> is an annual prize given by the Association for Computing Machinery to an individual selected for contributions of lasting and major technical importance to the computer field.  It has been called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prizes_known_as_the_Nobel_of_a_field">nobel prize of computing</a>.</p>
    <h3>Fran's Contribution</h3>
    <p> Fran won the A.M. Turing Award in 2006, becoming the first female computer scientist to do so.</p>

        <p>"Fran Allen's focus has not been on inventing new programming languages or language features and then trying to get people to program using them.</p> <p>Rather, she focused on taking programs as programmers like to write them, and made them run efficiently by doing sophisticated analysis and optimization of the code. She didnâ€™t create paper designs, but a series of working systems that run real programs, not just artificial benchmarks, faster. </p><p>Today's programming language compilers still rely on techniques that she pioneered."</p>
