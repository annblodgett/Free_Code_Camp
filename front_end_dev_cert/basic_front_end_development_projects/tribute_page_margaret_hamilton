 <p>"Born ca. 1938, Margaret Hamilton graduated from Hancock High School in 1954 and then attended Earlham College in Richmond Indiana graduating in 1958 as a <strong>major in mathematics</strong>. She moved to Massachusetts with the intention of doing graduate study at Brandeis but instead <strong>took a position at MIT where she learned to write software for computers.
 </strong>She postponed her graduate work for a chance to work on software for the Apollo program and eventually <strong> became the director of software programming at MITâ€™s Instrumentation Laboratory </strong> or the Apollo and Skylab NASA missions, <strong>overseeing the moon flights.</strong> She produced <strong>over 130 papers </strong>, proceedings and reports. 
<strong>In 1986, she founded and became CEO of Hamilton Technologies, in Cambridge MA, a software company.</strong> She has been <strong>recognized</strong> with the Augusta Ada Lovelace Award by the Association of Women in Computing in 1986 and the NASA Exceptional Space Act Award, in 2003 <strong> for her contributions to the Apollo Program and to the field of software engineering.</strong>"<small>Cambridge Women's Heritage Project Database, H.
